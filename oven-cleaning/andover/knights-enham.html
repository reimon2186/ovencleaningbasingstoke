                                <h3>Step 1: Scheduling & Courtesy Call</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Begin by requesting a no-cost, no-obligation quote that’s tailored to your oven’s condition. Once you approve, we book a suitable time slot for your cleaning. Expect a friendly call on the day of service, letting you know we’re on our way.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Assessment & Protection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When we arrive, we carry out an in-depth assessment of your oven to spot any hidden issues and confirm all parts are functional. We also protect your kitchen surfaces and floors with coverings to shield them from any accidental mess or damage.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We detach all removable parts—like racks, trays, and panels—and submerge them in our heated dip tank in the van. This process softens and eliminates stubborn buildup. Meanwhile, the oven’s interior is treated with eco-friendly products to dislodge burnt-on grease, restoring a spotless surface.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Final Polish and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After washing and polishing the individual components, we methodically reattach every piece, ensuring everything lines up perfectly. Our attention to detail guarantees your oven not only looks pristine but also operates seamlessly.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Closing Check & Tidy-Up</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once we finish, we double-check that the oven meets our high standards—both aesthetically and functionally. We then tidy up the area, leaving your kitchen as clean as (or cleaner than) it was before, with your oven ready for immediate use.
