                                <p>
                                    Your journey starts by reaching out for a customized, no-obligation quote. Once you’re satisfied, we’ll arrange a visit at a time that suits your schedule. Expect a courtesy call on your service day so you’re fully aware of our estimated arrival.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Thorough Inspection & Prep</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arriving, our technicians carry out a detailed inspection of your oven, checking for any hidden issues and ensuring every component is functional. We then protect your kitchen surfaces and floors, minimizing mess and preventing accidental damage during our work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    All removable parts—such as trays, racks, and panels—are carefully taken out and placed in our heated dip tank inside the van. This loosens even the toughest grease build-up. While they soak, we tackle the oven’s interior with specialized, eco-friendly products, dissolving carbon deposits and reviving its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After cleaning the oven cavity, we polish every accessible surface for a fresh, rejuvenated appearance. We then reattach all components, making sure everything lines up perfectly to guarantee smooth operation. Our thorough approach means you’ll have an oven that both sparkles and performs reliably.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Verification & Cleanup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To conclude, we carry out a final walkthrough, confirming your appliance is pristine and fully operational. Our technicians also clear away any protective coverings, leaving your kitchen just as tidy as they found it—except with a gleaming oven ready for immediate use.
