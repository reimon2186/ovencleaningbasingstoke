                                <h3>Step 1: Booking & Confirmation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Your oven’s transformation begins with a quick phone call or message for a complimentary quote tailored to your needs. Once you’re happy with the estimate, we’ll set a date and time that conveniently fits your routine. Expect a brief call on the day of service, ensuring you’re ready when we arrive.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Initial Inspection & Setup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, we assess your oven’s condition, identifying any issues and confirming all parts function properly. We also protect your kitchen floors and countertops using drop cloths or similar coverings—keeping everything clean and safeguarded from damage or spills.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Next, we remove any detachable items—racks, trays, and panels—and place them in a heated dip tank in our van. This soaks away baked-on grease and food remnants. Meanwhile, we focus on the oven interior, using eco-friendly products to dissolve grime and restore its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Reassembly & Polishing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After soaking and scrubbing all parts, we rinse and polish them to ensure a neat finish. We then reassemble everything carefully, confirming that each element fits securely for optimal functionality. Our thorough approach ensures an oven that looks brand new and works flawlessly.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Checks</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the last step, we do a final inspection to make sure everything is spotless and fully operational. Then, we clear our working materials, leaving your kitchen just as we found it—except with a gleaming oven ready to handle your next culinary creation.
