                                <h3>Step 1: Easy Booking & Scheduling</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Your journey begins when you reach out for a complimentary, no-obligation quote. We’ll settle on a convenient appointment slot that fits your schedule. On the day of your service, you’ll receive a friendly heads-up call so you’re never left guessing.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: In-Depth Assessment</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once we arrive, we perform a comprehensive assessment of your oven, checking for any underlying issues and verifying that each component is in working order. We also protect your counters and floors with protective coverings, ensuring no stray mess.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="step3gap">Step 3: Targeted Deep Cleaning</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—trays, racks, panels—and place them in a heated dip tank outside in our van. This immersion dissolves the most stubborn grime. While those soak, we treat the oven’s interior with eco-friendly products, eliminating baked-on grease and restoring its original sparkle.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After scrubbing and rinsing each part, we polish all surfaces to achieve a bright, near-new shine. We then carefully put your oven back together, confirming that every piece is securely positioned for optimal performance. Our meticulous approach ensures your appliance both looks fantastic and functions flawlessly.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Verification & Cleanup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, we do a detailed inspection to verify the oven is pristine and operating as intended. We then tidy up the workspace, returning your kitchen to the exact condition we found it in—except with a gleaming, refreshed oven ready for action.
