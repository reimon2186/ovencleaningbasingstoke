                                <h3>Step 1: Booking Your Service</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To begin, give us a call or send a message for a no-obligation quote aligned with your oven’s condition. Once you’re happy with our pricing, we’ll schedule an appointment at a time that suits you. On the day of service, expect a quick call to let you know we’re on our way.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We start by examining your oven, checking all its components for proper functionality and identifying any areas needing extra care. We also safeguard your kitchen floors and countertops with protective materials, ensuring there’s no mess or damage.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="step3gap">Step 3: Deep Cleaning</h3>
                                <p>
                                    All removable parts—such as racks, trays, and panels—are taken out and soaked in our heated dip tank, which effectively loosens stubborn grease. Meanwhile, we treat the oven’s interior with eco-friendly agents to eliminate carbon buildup and restore a gleaming finish.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After thoroughly cleaning, rinsing, and polishing each part, we carefully put everything back together. Our attention to detail ensures your oven looks like new and functions flawlessly. Every bolt and piece is returned to its proper place, so you can enjoy reliable cooking performance.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Before leaving, we conduct a final inspection to guarantee the oven meets our high standards of cleanliness. We also clear our workspace, leaving your kitchen just as we found it—except now you have a refreshed, ready-to-use oven waiting.
