                                <p>
                                    Start by getting in touch for a complimentary, no-obligation quote. Once you’re satisfied with our estimate, we’ll schedule a service time that suits your routine. Expect a brief reminder call on the day we’re due to arrive, so you’ll be prepared for our visit.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Initial Inspection & Protection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once on-site, we thoroughly examine your oven, looking for any issues or areas needing special attention. We also protect your floors and kitchen surfaces with coverings, safeguarding them from any potential mess or damage during the cleaning process.

                                    We remove all the detachable parts—such as racks, trays, and panels—and soak them in our heated dip tank located in the van. This treatment loosens even the toughest grease. Meanwhile, inside the oven, we apply eco-friendly agents that break down built-up carbon deposits, leaving your appliance’s interior fresh and bright.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After all components are cleaned, rinsed, and polished, we carefully reassemble your oven. Our attention to detail ensures that every part is aligned and functioning correctly, so you can enjoy reliable cooking performance and a freshly revitalized look.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Inspection & Tidy-Up</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Lastly, we conduct a thorough inspection to confirm everything meets our high standards of cleanliness and operation. We clear our workspace, leaving your kitchen as it was—just with a spotless oven ready to tackle your next culinary adventure.
