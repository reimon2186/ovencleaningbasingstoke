                                <p>
                                    Your journey begins by contacting us for a free, no-obligation quote customized to your oven’s condition. If you’re happy with the estimate, we’ll schedule a convenient service time. Expect a quick courtesy call on the day of your appointment, keeping you fully informed of our arrival.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After we arrive, we carry out a thorough inspection of your oven to identify any problem areas. To protect your kitchen, we cover your floors and countertops, ensuring no mess or damage occurs while we work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—like racks, trays, and panels—and soak them in our heated dip tank located in the van. This process loosens grease and stubborn grime. Meanwhile, we apply eco-friendly cleaning agents to your oven’s interior to dissolve built-up carbon and restore its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once each part is scrubbed clean and polished, we reassemble your oven with precision, confirming every component is correctly positioned. Our focused attention to detail ensures a spotless, near-new finish and reliable performance.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To conclude, we carry out a final inspection to confirm your oven meets our high standards of cleanliness and functionality. We also tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen as it was—except with a rejuvenated, sparkling oven ready for your next culinary creation.
