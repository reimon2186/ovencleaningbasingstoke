                                <p>
                                    Your journey begins when you reach out for a free, no-obligation quote—customized to your specific oven and cleaning requirements. Once you approve the estimate, we’ll book an appointment for a time that suits you. On the day of service, expect a brief courtesy call to let you know we’re on our way.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Initial Inspection & Setup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, our technicians carry out a detailed inspection of your oven, noting any problem areas or worn components. We also protect your kitchen floors and work surfaces with coverings to ensure everything stays tidy and free from damage during the cleaning.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Next, we remove all detachable parts—racks, trays, and back panels—and place them in our heated dip tank in the van. This soaking process loosens tough grease and residue, while we treat your oven’s interior with eco-friendly products to dissolve carbon buildup and restore its original sheen.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once each piece has been thoroughly cleaned, we polish them to a near-new gleam. We then reassemble your oven with precision, making certain every component is correctly aligned for optimum performance. Our attention to detail guarantees your oven will look spectacular and function flawlessly.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, we conduct a comprehensive inspection to confirm your oven meets our exacting standards of cleanliness and safety. We also tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen exactly as we found it—except with a rejuvenated oven ready for all your cooking needs.
