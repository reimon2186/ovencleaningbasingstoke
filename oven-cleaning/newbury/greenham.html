                                <h3>Step 1: Scheduling & Consultation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Reach out for a complimentary, no-obligation quote that aligns with your oven’s specific needs. Once you’re satisfied, we’ll pencil in an appointment at a time that suits you. Expect a quick courtesy call on the day, confirming our arrival to keep you fully informed.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection & Protection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, we examine your oven thoroughly, taking note of any areas that need special attention. We then protect your floors and countertops with coverings, ensuring no unwanted mess or damage occurs in your kitchen while we work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—racks, trays, panels—and place them in our heated dip tank in the van, where caked-on grease and debris are loosened and dissolved. Meanwhile, we treat the oven’s interior with safe, eco-friendly products that break down burnt-on residue and restore its natural shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After each piece has been cleaned, rinsed, and polished, we carefully reassemble your oven. Our detail-oriented approach ensures that all components fit properly and function optimally, leaving your oven looking like new.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Inspection & Cleanup                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Lastly, we perform a thorough inspection, verifying your oven meets our stringent standards of cleanliness and performance. We tidy up our workspace, so your kitchen is left exactly as we found it—except for an oven that’s now gleaming and ready for use.
