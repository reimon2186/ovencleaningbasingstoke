                                <p>

After you approve the quote, we’ll arrange a convenient appointment.

                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once on-site, we carefully examine your oven to identify any existing issues and confirm all components are functioning properly. We also cover your floors and surrounding kitchen surfaces to protect them from any possible mess or damage while we work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—including racks, trays, and back panels—and place them into a heated dip tank in our van. This soak helps loosen stubborn grime. Meanwhile, we clean the oven’s interior using eco-friendly products that effectively eliminate burnt-on carbon, revealing its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After thoroughly cleaning the interior, we polish every surface to achieve a showroom-fresh appearance. We then reassemble your oven with care, ensuring all components are securely in place and fully operational. Our attention to detail guarantees flawless results.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Before we finish, we conduct a final inspection to confirm your oven is spotless and functioning perfectly. We leave your kitchen just as we found it—only now, you have a gleaming oven ready for use.
