                                <p>
                                    To get started, simply contact us for a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your oven’s condition and needs. Once you approve, we’ll work out a date and time that suits your calendar. On the day of service, expect a short courtesy call letting you know we’re on our way.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, our technicians perform a careful inspection, noting any problem areas and verifying that all components are functioning properly. We also protect your kitchen floors and counters with coverings, ensuring no mess or damage occurs while we clean.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="step3gap">Step 3: Deep Cleaning</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Next, we remove all detachable elements—racks, trays, and panels—and immerse them in our heated dip tank out in the van. This process dissolves built-up grease, allowing us to thoroughly clean and sanitize each piece. Meanwhile, we use eco-friendly products on the oven interior to dislodge burnt-on grime, restoring a shiny, refreshed surface.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once everything is spotless, we polish each part to give it a renewed gleam. We then carefully reassemble your oven, making sure every piece is secure and in optimal working order. Our attention to detail guarantees you’ll have an oven that looks fantastic and performs reliably.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Our last step is a final inspection to confirm your oven meets our exacting standards of cleanliness and functionality. We also tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen just as we found it—apart from your pristine oven, of course, ready for your next cooking endeavor.
