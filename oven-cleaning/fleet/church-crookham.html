                                <h3>Step 1: Booking & Scheduling</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Your journey starts when you reach out for a free, no-obligation quote based on your oven’s condition. After you approve, we’ll confirm an appointment slot that best fits your timetable. On the day of service, expect a brief call beforehand so you know exactly when to anticipate our arrival.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Initial Inspection & Protection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once on-site, we examine your oven to identify any specific issues, as well as ensure all components are in good working order. We also protect your floors and countertops with coverings, keeping your kitchen clean and safeguarded during our work.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="step3gap">Step 3: Deep Cleaning & Degreasing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—such as racks, trays, and back panels—and place them in our specialized heated dip tank out in the van. This soak breaks down stubborn grease and baked-on residues. Meanwhile, we use eco-friendly products on the oven interior to dissolve grime, bringing back its natural shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After thoroughly cleaning each component, we rinse and polish them for a refreshed, near-new finish. We then carefully reassemble your oven, making certain every part is in the correct position. This careful attention to detail ensures an appliance that not only looks spotless but also functions optimally.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As a last step, we do a final walkthrough, verifying your oven meets our high standards of cleanliness and performance. We also tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen exactly as it was—apart from your revitalized, gleaming oven ready for use.
