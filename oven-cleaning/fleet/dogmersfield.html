                                <p>
                                    Your journey starts by reaching out for a free, no-obligation quote, tailored to your specific oven needs. If you’re happy with the estimate, we’ll arrange a convenient time slot. On the day of your service, expect a short call confirming our arrival—so you’re never caught by surprise.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When we arrive, our team conducts a detailed inspection of your oven, identifying any trouble spots and verifying everything is in working order. We also shield your kitchen surfaces and floors with coverings, preventing unwanted mess or damage while we work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable parts—racks, trays, and back panels—and immerse them in our heated dip tank in the van, which dissolves stubborn grime. Meanwhile, the oven’s interior is treated with eco-friendly solutions that eliminate burnt-on grease, restoring its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After every piece has been scrubbed clean and polished, we reassemble your oven with utmost care, ensuring each component is correctly positioned. This painstaking attention to detail guarantees your oven both looks immaculate and functions reliably when we’re finished.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches and Cleanup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To wrap things up, we carry out a comprehensive final inspection to confirm your oven is spotless and running optimally. We then tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen as we found it—except with a beautifully renewed oven at your service.
