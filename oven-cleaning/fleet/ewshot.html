                                <p>
                                    Start by getting in touch for a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your oven’s specific condition. Once you’re satisfied with our estimate, we’ll arrange a visit at a time that suits you best. Expect a quick confirmation call on the service day, so you’ll know exactly when to anticipate our arrival.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, we carry out a detailed inspection of your oven, pinpointing any trouble spots and verifying that all components function as intended. We also protect your kitchen flooring and nearby surfaces with coverings, ensuring no mess or damage occurs during cleaning.
                                </p>

                                    We carefully remove all detachable parts—such as trays, racks, and panels—and place them in a heated dip tank in our van to loosen tough grime. Meanwhile, we apply eco-friendly products to the interior, dissolving burnt-on residue and bringing back your oven’s original sheen.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After thoroughly cleaning and polishing each piece, we reassemble your oven with precision, confirming everything is properly aligned and secure. Our attention to detail ensures that your oven not only looks rejuvenated but also operates at its best.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Before we wrap up, we perform a comprehensive inspection to confirm your oven meets our high standards of cleanliness and performance. We then tidy up our workspace, leaving your kitchen exactly how we found it—except with a beautifully refreshed oven.
