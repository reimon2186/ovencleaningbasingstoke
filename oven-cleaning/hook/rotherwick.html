                                <h3>Step 1: Booking Your Service</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Get started by requesting a free, no-obligation quote that aligns with your oven’s condition and needs. Once you’re satisfied, we’ll schedule an appointment at a time convenient for you. Expect a quick call on the day of service to confirm our arrival, so you’re always in the loop.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After arriving on-site, we perform a detailed inspection of your oven, noting any problem areas or damaged parts. We also protect your kitchen surfaces with coverings to keep everything spotless and safeguard against any accidental mess.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    All removable components—like racks, trays, and back panels—are placed in our specialized heated dip tank located in the van. This process loosens and dissolves tough grease. Meanwhile, the oven’s interior is treated with eco-friendly products that eliminate carbon build-up, restoring its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once the interior and detachable parts are thoroughly cleaned, we polish each surface for a gleaming finish. We then reassemble your oven, ensuring every component is properly aligned for optimal performance. Our detail-focused approach guarantees exceptional results each time.

                
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As a last step, we conduct a full inspection to confirm your oven is both spotless and functioning correctly. We tidy up our work area, leaving your kitchen exactly as we found it—except for your refreshed oven, ready for immediate use.
