                                <p>
                                    To start, get in touch with us for a no-obligation quote based on your specific needs. Once you approve, we’ll pick a date and time that fits neatly into your calendar. Prior to our arrival, expect a quick call so you know exactly when we’ll be there.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Comprehensive Inspection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    On arriving at your home, our technicians conduct a thorough evaluation of your oven. We look for any problematic areas and verify that all elements are functioning correctly. We also protect your kitchen surfaces and floors to prevent any risk of damage or mess during the process.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="step3gap">Step 3: Intensive Cleaning and Degreasing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Next, we remove each detachable piece—such as racks, trays, and panels—and submerge them in a specialized heated dip tank located in our van. While the grime and grease on these parts are dissolving, we work on the oven’s interior using safe, eco-friendly solutions that effectively eradicate baked-on residue, restoring shine and performance.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After every corner of your oven interior has been properly cleaned, we polish all surfaces to give your appliance a sleek, like-new appearance. We then reassemble every piece with care, making certain everything is aligned and securely in place to guarantee optimal functionality.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Check and Tidy-Up</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Our last step is a meticulous inspection to confirm your oven is immaculate and ready to be used. We tidy up our workspace thoroughly so that your kitchen looks just as it did before—except with a rejuvenated oven waiting for your next culinary adventure.
