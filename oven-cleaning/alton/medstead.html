                                <p>
                                    Get in touch with us to receive a free, no-obligation quote based on your specific requirements. Once you’re happy with our estimate, we’ll schedule your appointment. On the day of service, we’ll give you a quick courtesy call so you know exactly when to expect us.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arriving, we conduct a thorough inspection of your oven to note any issues and confirm that all parts are functioning properly. We also protect your floors and surrounding kitchen surfaces with coverings, keeping your space clean and safeguarded from potential damage.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable items—like racks, trays, and back panels—and place them in our heated dip tank in the van. This process effectively loosens and dissolves stubborn grease. Meanwhile, we apply eco-friendly products to the oven’s interior, eliminating burnt-on carbon and restoring its original shine.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Once the inside is thoroughly cleaned, we polish every surface for a fresh, like-new finish. We then reassemble your oven with precision, ensuring each component is secure and working correctly. Our goal is a spotless oven that looks and performs flawlessly.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, we carry out a comprehensive inspection to confirm your oven is both spotless and functioning at its best. We remove our protective materials, leaving your kitchen exactly as we found it—except now you have a gleaming oven ready for use.
