                                <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Your BBQ’s transformation begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your grill’s size and condition. Once you approve our estimate, we’ll schedule an appointment at a time that fits your schedule. On the day of service, expect a quick courtesy call confirming our arrival, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Upon arrival, our technicians conduct a thorough inspection of your BBQ, identifying any heavily soiled or damaged parts. We then protect your patio or deck area with drop cloths or coverings, ensuring your outdoor space remains clean and free from any accidental spills or debris during the cleaning process.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We remove all detachable components—such as grill plates, racks, and heat shields—and place them in our heated dip tank located in our van. This soaking process effectively loosens and dissolves stubborn grease, carbon buildup, and food residues. Meanwhile, we treat the BBQ’s interior and exterior surfaces with our eco-friendly cleaning agents, ensuring a complete and polished finish.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing and Reassembly</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After each component has been thoroughly cleaned, rinsed, and polished, we carefully reassemble your BBQ, ensuring that every part is correctly aligned and secured for optimal performance. Our special polishing product is then applied to prevent rust and weathering, giving your BBQ a renewed, sleek appearance that stands up to the elements.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Inspection & Tidy-Up</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We conclude with a comprehensive final inspection to verify that your BBQ meets our strict standards of cleanliness and functionality. We then tidy up our workspace, leaving your outdoor area exactly as we found it—except for your beautifully revitalized BBQ, ready for immediate use.

                            We recommend scheduling a professional BBQ cleaning twice a year, depending on how much you use your grill. Regular cleaning not only maintains optimal performance and hygiene but also extends the lifespan of your BBQ. We especially encourage a thorough clean before putting your BBQ away for winter. Cleaning before winter prevents rust and weathering caused by accumulated carbon and grease, ensuring your BBQ is ready to go for next summer.
